My documentation for the required reading for JavaScript developers.
[Professional JavaScript for Web Developers 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481969158&sr=1-1&keywords=professional+javascript+for+web+developers)
